## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.


## Files in this respository : 

The `run_analysis.R` assumes that all the data files needed are present in the same folder, un-compressed and filenames unaltered.

The code in `run_analysis.R`does :
 * 1.Read & Merges the training and the test sets. 
 * 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 * 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
 * 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  Finally, creates the one big data set.
 * 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



"CodeBook.md" describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.


"tiny.txt" is the output from step 5.
